/*
  DEPRECATED: ambient shim replaced by installed @types/react-router-dom.
  Please delete this file to avoid duplicate/ambiguous declarations.

  I cannot remove files via the current toolset, so I've left this file
  intentionally short and clearly marked. You can safely delete it:

  - Delete via shell / file explorer: rm react-frontend/src/types/react-router-dom.d.ts
  - Or in VS Code: right-click the file and "Delete".

  After deleting, run a TypeScript check or dev build to confirm everything is
  resolved with the installed types: `npm run build` or `npm run start`.
